"""
Taken from our Complete Python Course: https://go.tecla.do/cpc

Purely as an example, a function can have multiple decorators.

Decorators are applied from bottom to top, which means the top decorator is the first one to be evaluated when the function is executed.

In this example, we have two decorators. One checks the user's access_level, the other checks the user's username (must start with the letter 'j').

# Try the various combinations below!
user = {"username": "jose123", "access_level": "admin"}
# user = {'username': 'bob', 'access_level': 'admin'}
# user = {'username': 'jose123', 'access_level': 'user'}
user = {"username": "bob", "access_level": "user"}

    This decorator only runs the function passed if the user's username starts with a j.

    return "I ran."


print(double_decorator())

"""
When `double_decorator()` runs, this chain of "functions" runs:

user_has_permission -> user_name_starts_with_j -> double_decorator

That is because `user_name_starts_with_j` is the first decorator to be applied. It replaces `double_decorator` by the function it returns.

Then, `user_has_permission` is appliedâ€”and it replaces the function the other decorator returned by the function it returns.
